BUILDING MÃ¶rder
========

First you shall need:

  0. Java SE Development Kit (JDK).
  1. Android Software Development Kit (Android SDK).
  2. This code.

You should read ./android/build.gradle and note the versions of build tools and platforms required. Gradle takes care of a lot.

Generally you should set JAVA\_HOME and ANDROID\_HOME to the roots of your JDK and Android SDK.

Gradle Tasks
------------

./gradlew build

Will do a general build.

./gradlew installDebug

Will also try to shove it onto your device via the Android Debugging Bridge (adb).
