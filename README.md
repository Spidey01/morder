Morder -- Assassinate your browser
==================================

Basic goal is to replace Chrome. First on Android tablet and then on desktop
and phone if possible.

My priorities are this:

  1. Performance.
  2. Usability.
  3. Reliability.


Also it would be nice to not pull my hair out in frustration.

Performance
-----------

This is the thing in shortest supply when using Chrome on an Android tablet.
I don't care how it happens but the goal is to be a speedy son of a gun. I
would rather have a minimalist out of my face UI and just a straight up,
immersive browsing experience. Don't need no Chrome just super cruise.

The minimum acceptable level of performance should be what a raw web view
widget can offer on the platform.

Usability
---------

I don't care big woop about Material or Holo design or whatever GNOME is doing.
What I want is something very slick and usable because I'm going to be using
the thing a lot. Power user of the 16 hour computing day first. Style guides
ninth.

Reliability
-----------

If you want to see me rage just force me to use a crash happy install of
Mozilla Firefox from the pre-browser-session-restore and
chrome-sandbox-borrowing era. That's right bub.
