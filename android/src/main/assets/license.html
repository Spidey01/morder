      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br/>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br/>

<br/>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br/>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br/>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br/>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>
<br/>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br/>

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br/>
<br/>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br/>
<br/>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>
      meet the following conditions:<br/>
<br/>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>
<br/>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
<br/>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>
          the Derivative Works; and<br/>
<br/>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>
          as modifying the License.<br/>
<br/>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
<br/>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
<br/>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
<br/>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>
<br/>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
<br/>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

        <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li><strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means a work based upon
          the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
          such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
          arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary
          or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
          includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
          which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
          including in any form recognizably derived from the
          original, except that a work that constitutes a
          Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
          purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
          where the Work is a musical work, performance or
          phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
          considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
          License.</li>

          <li><strong>"Collection"</strong> means a collection of
          literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
          anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
          or other works or subject matter other than works listed
          in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
          and arrangement of their contents, constitute
          intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
          its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
          other contributions, each constituting separate and
          independent works in themselves, which together are
          assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
          Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
          License.</li>

          <li><strong>"Distribute"</strong> means to make available
          to the public the original and copies of the Work or
          Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
          transfer of ownership.</li>

          <li><strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual,
          individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work

          <li><strong>"Original Author"</strong> means, in the case
          of a literary or artistic work, the individual,
          individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or
          if no individual or entity can be identified, the
          publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
          performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
          other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
          interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
          or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
          phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
          who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
          sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
          organization that transmits the broadcast.</li>

          <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the literary and/or
          artistic work offered under the terms of this License
          including without limitation any production in the
          literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
          the mode or form of its expression including digital
          form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
          lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
          nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
          choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a
          musical composition with or without words; a
          cinematographic work to which are assimilated works
          expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a
          work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
          engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
          are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
          photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
          plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
          geography, topography, architecture or science; a
          performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
          data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
          work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
          performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
          literary or artistic work.</li>

          <li><strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity
          exercising rights under this License who has not
          previously violated the terms of this License with
          respect to the Work, or who has received express
          permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
          this License despite a previous violation.</li>

          <li><strong>"Publicly Perform"</strong> means to perform
          public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the
          public those public recitations, by any means or process,
          including by wire or wireless means or public digital
          performances; to make available to the public Works in
          such a way that members of the public may access these
          Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
          them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or
          process and the communication to the public of the
          performances of the Work, including by public digital
          performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
          means including signs, sounds or images.</li>

          <li><strong>"Reproduce"</strong> means to make copies of
          the Work by any means including without limitation by
          sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
          reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
          protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
          other electronic medium.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this
        License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
        free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
        exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
        copyright protection under copyright law or other
        applicable laws.</p>

        <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
        a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
        the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
        exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
          one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
          incorporated in the Collections;</li>

          <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
          such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
          takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
          otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
          Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
          original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
          a modification could indicate "The original work has been
          modified.";</li>

              <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License

              right to collect royalties through any statutory or
              compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the

              administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that

        <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:</p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
          on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
          the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that
          restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
          to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
          requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
          any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
          from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
          4(b), as requested.</li>

          <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
          any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
          request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
          intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
          reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
          the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
          applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
          and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
          attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
          means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
          of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
          practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
          be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
          for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in
          the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
          reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
          a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
          appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
          credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
          without the separate, express prior written permission of
          the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties.</li>

          <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
          or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
          You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
          Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
          take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
          which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
          or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
          jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
          right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
          to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
          mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
          prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
          reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
          permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
          to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
          this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
          otherwise.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and
        Disclaimer</strong></p>

        <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
        WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
        WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
        ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
        PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO
        THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
        LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
        EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
          terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
          terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
          received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
          License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
          provided such individuals or entities remain in full
          compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
          and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</li>

          <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
          license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
          the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
          the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
          Work under different license terms or to stop
          distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
          any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
          (or any other license that has been, or is required to
          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
          License will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
          license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
          the license granted to You under this License.</li>

          <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
          Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
          the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
          license granted to You under this License.</li>

          <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.</li>

          <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
          waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
          consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

          <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between
          the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
          not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
          in any communication from You. This License may not be
          modified without the mutual written agreement of the
          Licensor and You.</li>

          <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter
          referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
          terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
          Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
          1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
          Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
          Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
          revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
          matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
          the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
          the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
          those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
          If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
          copyright law includes additional rights not granted
          under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
          be included in the License; this License is not intended
          to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
          law.</li>
